This repository contains the following subdirectories, which each contain their own README to further describe their content:
 - MESA\_StORM\_setup : A directory containing the MESA work directory, nuclear rates cache, and StORM commands used to produce the grid of stellar models and its oscillation computations.
 - tables : Tables and a README in the CDS format containing the data necessary to reproduce the figures and results presented in the paper. 
 - kernels : Figures of the sensitivity kernels of all rotationally split multiplets in our sample. 
 - models : For each star in the sample, we provide a subdirectory containing the best model, including all predicted frequencies, and the MESA profile, GYRE input model and history data nearest to the best model.
