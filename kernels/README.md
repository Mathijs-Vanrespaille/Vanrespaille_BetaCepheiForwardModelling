This directory displays the normalised sensitivity kernels of all the modelled non-radial multiplets in our sample. Each star is given one row of panels, and each of the four figures -- available in both .png and .pdf formats -- contains nine stars. Each of these panels shows the sensitivity kernels against normalised radius, and also includes the name of the star, the degree and radial order of the modelled multiplet and the zonal frequency of the multiplet.
